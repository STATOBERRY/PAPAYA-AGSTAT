# Central tendency II

While simple averages like mean, median, and mode are widely used to summarize data, certain situations call for more specialized measures to capture the essence of a dataset. **Special averages**, including the **geometric mean** and **harmonic mean**, are tailored for specific contexts where the nature of the data or the relationships between data points require a different approach.

## Geometric mean (GM)

The **geometric mean** is a specialized measure of central tendency, particularly suited for datasets involving growth rates, ratios, or percentages, such as population growth, investment returns, or interest rates. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which calculates the average by summing values, the geometric mean finds the average by multiplying values and then taking the root (typically the n^th^ root for n values).

This approach captures the compounding effects present in the data, making the geometric mean an essential tool for accurately summarizing proportional changes or rates over time. Its utility lies in providing a more representative measure for datasets where changes are multiplicative rather than additive.

The geometric mean of a series containing *n* observations is the *n*^th^ root of the product of the values. If $x_{1},x_{2},\ldots, x_{n}$ are observations then

$$\mathbf{GM =}\sqrt[\mathbf{n}]{\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{2}}\mathbf{\ldots}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{n}}}$$ {#eq-gm1}

$$\mathbf{=}\left( \mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{2}}\mathbf{\ldots}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{n}} \right)^{\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{n}}}$$

$$\mathbf{\log}\mathbf{\text{GM}}\mathbf{=}\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{\log}\left( \mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{2}}\mathbf{\ldots}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{n}} \right)$$

$$\mathbf{=}\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{n}}\left( \mathbf{\log}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{+}\mathbf{\log}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{2}}\mathbf{\ldots +}\mathbf{\log}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{n}} \right)$$

$$\mathbf{=}\frac{\sum_{\mathbf{i = 1}}^{\mathbf{n}}{\mathbf{\log}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{i}}}}{\mathbf{n}}$$ {#eq-gm2}

$$\mathbf{\ GM = Antilog}\left( \frac{\sum_{\mathbf{i = 1}}^{\mathbf{n}}{\mathbf{\log}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{i}}}}{\mathbf{n}} \right)$$ {#eq-gm3}

### Geometric mean for grouped frequency table data

$$\mathbf{GM = \ Antilog}\left( \frac{\sum_{\mathbf{i = 1}}^{\mathbf{k}}{{\mathbf{f}_{\mathbf{i}}\mathbf{\log}}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{i}}}}{\mathbf{n}} \right)$$ {#eq-gm4}

where $x_{i}$ is the mid-value, $f_{i}$ is the frequency , *k* is the number of classes

## Harmonic mean (HM)

Harmonic means are often used in averaging things like rates (e.g. the average travel speed given duration of several trips). Harmonic mean (HM) of a set of observations is defined as the reciprocal of the arithmetic average of the reciprocal of the given value.

::: {.callout-important title="Note"}  

Harmonic mean can be easily remembered as "reciprocal of the mean of the reciprocals"  

:::

If $x_{1},\ x_{2},\ldots,\ x_{n}$ are *n* observations then

$$\mathbf{\text{H.M}} = \frac{n}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\frac{1}{x_{i}}}$$ {#eq-hm1}

[In case of Frequency distribution]{.underline}

$$\mathbf{\text{H.M}} = \frac{n}{\sum_{i = 1}^{k}{f_{i}\frac{1}{x_{i}}}}$$ {#eq-hm2}  

where $x_{i}$ is the mid-value, $f_{i}$ is the frequency , *k* is the number of classes

[**Steps in calculating Harmonic Mean (H.M)**]{.underline}

1.  Calculate the reciprocal (1/value) for every value.

2.  Find the average of those reciprocals (just add them and divide by how many there are)

3.  Then do the reciprocal of that average (=1/average)

## Relation between AM, GM and HM

If AM stands for Arithmetic Mean, GM stands for Geometric Mean and HM stands for Harmonic Mean; then

$$\mathbf{\text{AM}}\mathbf{\times}\mathbf{\text{HM}}\mathbf{=}\mathbf{\text{GM}}^{\mathbf{2}}$$ {#eq-amgmhm}

also

$$\mathbf{AM \geq GM \geq HM}$$ {#eq-gretamgmhm}

## AM, GM or HM ?

Choosing the right average depends on what you’re measuring and how the data behaves. Let’s break it down step by step in a simple way:

**Arithmetic Mean (AM)**\
The arithmetic mean is the most common type of average. You use it when the values in your data add together in a straightforward way. This is suitable for quantities like:\
- Heights or weights\
- Lengths or distances\
- Marks in exams

For example, if you want to find the average height of students in a class, you add up all the heights and divide by the number of students. The arithmetic mean gives a meaningful average because height or weight adds linearly—it’s a direct measurement.

**Harmonic Mean (HM)**\
The harmonic mean is useful when you are working with rates, ratios, or situations where quantities add up as reciprocals. Some examples include:\
- Speeds (distance per unit time)\
- Capacitors in a series circuit\
- Rates like fuel efficiency or cost per unit

For instance, imagine you are driving the same distance at different speeds. If you want to find the average speed for the entire trip, the harmonic mean is the best choice. This is because speeds relate inversely to time—when you go faster, you take less time, and vice versa.

**Geometric Mean (GM)**\
The geometric mean is the right choice when your data involves multiplication or compounding, such as:\
- Growth rates (like population growth or interest rates)\
- Percentages (like inflation rates)\
- Ratios

For example, if you have annual interest rates for 10 years and want to find a single rate that represents the same total growth over that period, the geometric mean gives you the answer. It works by multiplying the rates and taking the root, which accounts for the compounding effect.

**Key Takeaways**\
1. Use **Arithmetic Mean** when values combine directly, like adding lengths or weights.\
2. Use **Harmonic Mean** for rates or quantities that work reciprocally, like speed or resistance.\
3. Use **Geometric Mean** for data involving multiplication or compounding, like growth rates or percentages.

By understanding the relationship between the data and the type of average, you can choose the most meaningful measure for your analysis.

## Positional Averages {#sec-positional_avg}

Positional averages are measures derived directly from the values in a dataset. These averages are based on the position of the values within the series and are used to represent the overall dataset or highlight specific positional characteristics.

::: {.callout-important title="Note"}
The **median** although a simple average is also a positional average that represents the middle value of an ordered dataset, making it a central point of reference. Similarly, the **mode**, which identifies the most frequently occurring value in the dataset, is also a positional average since it is directly taken from the series.
:::

The other common positional averages include **percentiles**, **quartiles**, and **deciles**, which divide the data into equal parts to analyze its distribution.

In contrast, measures like the **arithmetic mean**, **geometric mean**, and **harmonic mean** are referred to as **mathematical averages**, as they are calculated through specific mathematical operations rather than being derived from the data's positional properties.

## Quartiles {#quartile}

The **median** divides a dataset into two equal halves. Similarly, it is possible to divide a dataset into more than two parts. When an **ordered** dataset is divided into four equal sections, the points that mark these divisions are called **quartiles**.

The **first or lower quartile (**$\mathbf{Q}_{\mathbf{1}}$**)** is a value that has one fourth, or 25% of the observations below its value.

The **second quartile (**$\mathbf{Q}_{\mathbf{2}}$**)**, has one-half, or 50% of the observations below its value. The second quartile is equal to the **median**.

The **third or upper quartile**, **(**$\mathbf{Q}_{\mathbf{3}}$**)**, is a value that has three-fourths, or 75% of the observations below it.

$\mathbf{Q}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{=}\left( \frac{\mathbf{n + 1}}{\mathbf{4}} \right)^{\mathbf{\text{th}}}$ item  

$\mathbf{Q}_{\mathbf{3}}\mathbf{=}\left( \frac{\mathbf{3(n + 1)}}{\mathbf{4}} \right)^{\mathbf{\text{th}}}$ item   


Calculations of quartiles are explained using the example below. See in the example the procedure followed when a fraction appear in the calculation.

**Example 5.6**: Compute quartiles for the data 25, 18, 30, 8, 15, 5, 10, 35, 40, 45

**Solution 5.6**:

First arrange the data in ascending order

**5, 8, 10, 15, 18, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45**

here *n* = 10

$\mathbf{Q}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{=}\left(\frac{\mathbf{n + 1}}{\mathbf{4}} \right)^{\mathbf{\text{th}}}$ item  

*i*.*e*. $Q_{1} = \left( \frac{10 + 1}{4} \right)^{th}$ = 2.75^th^ item; when such a fraction appears we use the following procedure

$Q_{1} =$<!-- -->2.75^th^ item = 2^nd^ item + 0.75(3^rd^ item -- 2^nd^ item)

So from the given data $Q_{1}$= 8+0.75(10-- 8) = **9.5**

$$\mathbf{Q}_{\mathbf{2}}\mathbf{= median}$$

here $Q_{2} =$(18+25)/2 =  21.5  

$\mathbf{Q}_{\mathbf{3}}\mathbf{=}\left( \frac{\mathbf{3(n + 1)}}{\mathbf{4}} \right)^{\mathbf{\text{th}}}$ item  


*i*.*e*. $Q_{3} = \left( 3 \times \frac{(10 + 1)}{4} \right)^{th}$ = 8.25^th^ item = 8^th^ item + 0.25(9^th^ item --8^th^ item) = 35+0.25(40-35) = 36.25

The cumulative frequency value just greater than 6.25 is 7, the\
$\mathbf{x}$ value corresponding to cumulative frequency 7 is 8. So $\mathbf{Q}_{\mathbf{1}}$ = 8  


$\left( \frac{\mathbf{3(n + 1)}}{\mathbf{4}} \right)$ = $\left( \frac{\mathbf{3}\mathbf{\times}\mathbf{25}}{\mathbf{4}} \right)$ =  18.75

The cumulative frequency value just greater than 18.75 is 20, the\

5.  See in the cumulative frequencies the value just greater than $3\left( \frac{\mathbf{n}}{\mathbf{4}} \right)\mathbf{\ }$then the corresponding class interval is called **3^rd^ quartile class**. Then apply the respective formulae

$$\mathbf{Q}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{=}\mathbf{l}_{\mathbf{1}}\mathbf{+}\frac{\frac{\mathbf{n}}{\mathbf{4}}\mathbf{-}\mathbf{m}_{\mathbf{1}}}{\mathbf{f}_{\mathbf{1}}}\mathbf{\times}\mathbf{c}_{\mathbf{1}}$$ {#eq-qrtl1}

$f_{1}$ = frequency of the first quartile class

$c_{1}$ = width of the first quartile class

$m_{1}$ = cumulative frequency preceding the first quartile class

$f_{3}$= frequency of the 3^rd^ quartile class

$c_{3}$= width of the 3^rd^ quartile class

**Solution 5.8**:

$\left( \frac{n}{4} \right)$ = $\frac{204}{4}$ = 51

The cumulative frequency value just greater than 51 is 54 so the class 20-30 is the 1^st^ quartile class

using @eq-qrtl1

$$\mathbf{= 20 +}\frac{\mathbf{51 - 29}}{\mathbf{25}}\mathbf{\times 10\  = 28.8}$$

$3\left( \frac{n}{4} \right)$= $3 \times \frac{204}{4}$ = 153

The cumulative frequency value just greater than 153 is 167 so the class 60-70 is the 3^rd^ quartile class

using @eq-qrtl2

$$\mathbf{= 60 +}\frac{\mathbf{153 - 145}}{\mathbf{22}}\mathbf{\times 10 = 63.63}$$

## Percentiles

Percentiles divide an **ordered dataset** into 100 equal parts, with each part containing 1% of the observations. The **x**^th^ percentile, denoted as $P_x$, is the value below which **x** percent of the data falls.

For example:\
- The **50th percentile** is equivalent to the **median**, representing the middle value of the dataset.\
- The **25th percentile** corresponds to the first quartile ($Q_1$), which marks the lower 25% of the data.\
- The **75th percentile** is the third quartile ($Q_3$), indicating that 75% of the data falls below this value.

For raw data, first arrange the *n* observations in increasing order. Then the *x*^th^ percentile is given by

$\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{=}\left( \frac{\mathbf{x}\left( \mathbf{n + 1} \right)}{\mathbf{100}} \right)^{\mathbf{\text{th}}}$**item**

For a frequency distribution the *x*^th^ percentile is given by following steps

1.  Find cumulative frequencies

2.  Find $\left( \frac{\text{x.n}}{100} \right)$

3.  See in the cumulative frequencies, the value just greater than$\left( \frac{\text{x.n}}{100} \right)$and then the corresponding class interval is called **Percentile class**.

4.  Use the following formula

$$\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{= l +}\frac{\left( \frac{\mathbf{x \times n}}{\mathbf{100}} \right)\mathbf{- cf}}{\mathbf{f}}\mathbf{\times c}$$

Where

$\mathbf{l}$ = lower limit of the percentile class

$\mathbf{\text{cf}}$ = cumulative frequency preceding the percentile class

$\mathbf{f}$ = frequency of the percentile class

$\mathbf{c}$ = class interval

$\mathbf{n}$ = total number of observations

**Example 5.9**: Compute $\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{25}}$**and** $\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{75}}$ for the data 25, 18, 30, 8, 15, 5, 10, 35, 40, 45

**Solution 5.9**:

First arrange the data in ascending order

**5, 8, 10, 15, 18, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45**

Here *n* =10

$\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{25}}\mathbf{=}\left( \frac{\mathbf{25}\left( \mathbf{10 + 1} \right)}{\mathbf{100}} \right)^{\mathbf{\text{th}}}$**= 2.75^th^ item**

$P_{25} =$<!-- -->2.75^th^ item = 2^nd^ item + 0.75(3^rd^ item -- 2^nd^ item)

So from the given data $P_{25}$= 8+0.75(10-- 8) = **9.5**

$\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{75}}\mathbf{=}\left( \frac{\mathbf{75}\left( \mathbf{10 + 1} \right)}{\mathbf{100}} \right)^{\mathbf{\text{th}}}$**= 8.25^th^ item**

*i*.*e*. $P_{75} = \left( 75 \times \frac{10 + 1}{100} \right)^{th}$ = 8.25^th^ item = 8^th^ item + 0.25(9^th^ item --8^th^ item) = 35+0.25(40-35) =36.25

## Deciles

Deciles are similar to quartiles, but while quartiles consist of three points that divide an ordered dataset into four equal parts, deciles consist of 9 points that divide the dataset into ten equal parts. The **x**^th^ decile is denoted as $d_x$. It is important to note that the **median** is the **5th decile**.

$\mathbf{d}_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{=}\left( \frac{\mathbf{x}\left( \mathbf{n + 1} \right)}{\mathbf{10}} \right)^{\mathbf{\text{th}}}$**item**

For a frequency distribution the *x*^th^ decile is given by following steps

1.  Find cumulative frequencies

2.  Find $\left( \frac{\text{x.n}}{10} \right)$

3.  See in the cumulative frequencies, the value just greater than$\left( \frac{\text{x.n}}{10} \right)$and then the corresponding class interval is called **decile class**.

4.  Use the following formula

$$\mathbf{d}_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{= l +}\frac{\left( \frac{\mathbf{x \times n}}{\mathbf{10}} \right)\mathbf{- cf}}{\mathbf{f}}\mathbf{\times c}$$

Where

$\mathbf{l}$ = lower limit of the decile class

$\mathbf{\text{cf}}$ = cumulative frequency preceding the decile class

$\mathbf{f}$ = frequency of the decile class

$\mathbf{c}$ = class interval

$\mathbf{n}$ = total number of observations
