    "text": "For a long time, I have dreamed of writing a book that truly serves the needs of undergraduate students in agriculture—a book that demystifies statistics and makes it accessible and practical for their studies and research. Statistics, while being an essential tool in agricultural sciences, is often presented in ways that make it seem more complicated than it actually is. Textbooks in this field tend to delve into intricate details that go far beyond what most agricultural students require, leaving them overwhelmed and disconnected from the subject’s practical relevance.\nThis book is my humble attempt to change that. It has been written with undergraduate students in mind, focusing on the basics of statistics and their direct applications in agricultural research. Each chapter is designed to simplify complex concepts, making them clear, relatable, and easy to understand. While the primary audience is undergraduate students, this book can also serve as a helpful resource for anyone looking to brush up on the fundamentals of statistics.\nThe journey of writing this book has been greatly enriched by the feedback and insights of the students at the College of Agriculture, Vellayani. For two years, an earlier version of this book was made available on MeLON (Module for eLearning and Online Notes), our college’s online platform. The students, with their thoughtful suggestions and sharp observations, have helped refine the content and shape it into what it is today. Their enthusiasm and curiosity have been a constant source of inspiration throughout this process.\nI would also like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my co-authors, Dr. Manju Mary Paul, Dr. Adarsh V. S., and Mohammed Hisham M., whose expertise, commitment, and contributions have been invaluable in bringing this book to life. Their collaboration and dedication have greatly enhanced the quality and depth of this work.\nA special thanks to Jithin Chandran, Gaatha Prasad, Anjana Biwas T., and Varsha H. for their valuable suggestions and minor corrections. They were postgraduate students in Agricultural Statistics at the time of writing this book, and their support has significantly increased the quality of this work.\nI hope this textbook becomes a guiding light for students and researchers alike, helping them build a solid foundation in statistics while inspiring confidence in their ability to use these tools effectively. If this book makes statistics less intimidating and more approachable for even one reader, I will consider my efforts worthwhile.\nWith deep gratitude to my students, colleagues, and everyone who supported this work, I present this book as a tool to empower the next generation of agricultural scientists and researchers.\nDr. Pratheesh P. Gopinath\nHead\nDepartment of Agricultural Statistics\nCollege of Agriculture, Vellayani\n2 December 2024",

    "text": "1.1 The word “statistics”\nStatistics is the science of understanding, analyzing, and interpreting data. It plays a crucial role in making informed decisions across various fields, from agriculture to medicine, economics to environmental studies. This chapter serves as an entry point into the fascinating world of statistics, introducing you to its basic concepts and practical applications.\nWe begin by exploring the origins and definitions of statistics, emphasizing its relationship with mathematics and its distinct role in solving real-world problems. From there, we focus on the importance of data—the raw material of statistics—examining its types and how it is collected, organized, and analyzed.\nThe chapter also covers essential concepts such as population and sample, variables and constants, and the different types of variables. These concepts form the building blocks for understanding how statistical studies are designed and conducted.\nFinally, we introduce frequency distributions—an indispensable tool for summarizing and interpreting data. Topics such as construction of frequency distributions, grouped and cumulative frequency distributions, and relative frequency will help you make sense of data and uncover underlying patterns.\nBy the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the core principles of statistics, setting the stage for deeper exploration and advanced applications in later chapters. The concepts presented here are largely based on the works of (Goon and Dasgupta 1983) and (Gupta and Kapoor 1997)\nThe term statistics originates from the Neo-Latin word statisticum collegium, meaning “council of state,” and the Italian word statista, meaning “statesman” or “politician.” The German term Statistik emerged in the early 18th century and initially referred to the “collection and classification of data,” particularly data used by governments and administrative bodies. This usage was introduced by the German scholar Gottfried Achenwall in 1749, who is often credited as the founder of modern statistics.\nIn 1791, Sir John Sinclair introduced the term Statistik into English through his publication of the “Statistical Account of Scotland”(Ball 2004), a comprehensive 21-volume work. This marked the beginning of the use of the term statistics in English to describe the systematic collection and analysis of data. Later, in 1845, Francis G.P. Neison an actuary1 to the Medical Invalid and General Life Office published Contributions to Vital Statistics, the first book to include the word “statistics” in its title, focusing on actuarial and demographic data. These developments laid the foundation for statistics as a discipline, evolving from statecraft to a broader scientific approach to data analysis and interpretation.",

    "text": "1.2 Statistics and mathematics\nMathematics and statistics, while closely related, serve distinct purposes and operate on fundamentally different principles. Mathematics can be thought of as a well-organized library, where everything follows strict rules and logical paths. Once a theorem is proven in mathematics, it remains universally true, leaving little room for ambiguity or change. It is a deductive science, relying on precise axioms and logical reasoning to arrive at exact and unchanging results.\nStatistics, however, operates in a different realm. It deals with real-world data, which is often messy, unpredictable, and influenced by numerous uncontrolled factors. Statistics is more like an open field, where methods and approaches must adapt to the variability of data. Unlike the certainty of mathematics, statistics uses inductive reasoning to analyze data, account for randomness, and make decisions or predictions under uncertainty. This flexibility is essential because real-world phenomena, especially in fields like biology, are rarely as neat and predictable as mathematical constructs.\nIn biological sciences, we study complex systems such as plants, animals, and ecosystems, where exact outcomes are rarely achievable. These systems are influenced by a multitude of factors, many of which cannot be precisely measured or controlled. This is where the concept of the error term becomes important. The error term represents the difference between observed and predicted values in a statistical model, accounting for the inherent variability and uncertainty in biological phenomena.\nStatisticians embrace this uncertainty, developing mathematical models that approximate reality as closely as possible. Unlike mathematicians, whose focus is on achieving perfect precision, statisticians aim to draw meaningful insights from imperfect and variable data. In the study of biological systems, the goal is not to eliminate uncertainty but to understand patterns, relationships, and trends within the data.\nThus, while mathematics seeks absolute certainty, statistics accepts variability and uncertainty as fundamental characteristics of the real world. By acknowledging and incorporating these uncertainties, statisticians provide valuable tools to study and explain complex biological phenomena, making statistics an indispensable discipline for understanding the complexities of nature.",

Think of data as the building blocks that form the foundation for understanding the world around us. It’s the raw material from which we extract patterns, trends, and conclusions that help us make better decisions.\nIn today’s fast-paced world, data is more important than ever. From predicting weather patterns to optimizing business strategies, data is at the heart of nearly every advancement. Without data, we’re left with guesswork—making it impossible to understand complex systems or make informed decisions.\nHere are some examples of data in action:\n\nNumber of farmers in a village: Understanding this helps policymakers make decisions about agricultural development and rural economics.\nRainfall over a period of time: This data is crucial for predicting crop yields, planning irrigation, and managing water resources.\nArea under paddy crop in a state: This informs agricultural policies, resource allocation, and even global food supply chains.\n\nAs you can see, data isn’t just a collection of numbers; it’s the key to solving real-world problems and shaping the future. In the hands of skilled statisticians, data has the power to unlock insights that can improve lives, drive innovation, and guide decisions at every level.",

It supports decision-making by presenting facts in an organized manner, aids in the formulation of effective policies, facilitates comparisons, and assists in making forecasts. By applying appropriate statistical methods, researchers can draw valid conclusions from experiments.\nApplications of statistics: Statistics has become an integral part of almost every field of human activity. It is indispensable in areas such as administration, business, economics, research, banking, insurance, and more. Its ability to quantify and analyze data makes it an essential tool across industries.\nCommon limitations of statistics: Statistical methods are applicable only when there is variability in the data being studied. Statistics focuses on the analysis of groups or aggregates, rather than individual data points. The results derived from statistical analysis are often approximate and subject to uncertainty. Statistics is sometimes misapplied or misinterpreted, leading to erroneous conclusions.\nAs statisticians, we believe that the power of statistics knows no bounds. It’s a tool that, when applied correctly, can unlock insights from any dataset. While the limitations listed above are commonly found in textbooks and curricula across SAUs (State Agricultural Universities), I believe these are more about guiding students on the appropriate use of statistics rather than presenting true constraints. With the right methodology and approach, statistics can be applied in any situation to derive valuable insights and support sound decision-making.",

It will take us a long time to measure the height of all students of the college, so we may select 20 of the students and measure their height (in cm). Suppose we obtain the measurements like this :\n149, 156, 148, 161, 159, 143, 158, 152, 164, 171, 157, 152, 163,\n158, 151, 147, 157, 146, 153, 159.\nIn this study, we are interested in the height of all students in the college. The set of height of all students in the college is called the population of this study. The set of 20 height, H = {149, 156,148, …, 153, 159}, is a sample from this population.\nPopulation\nIn statistics, a population refers to the entire collection of elements, individuals, or objects that possess a particular characteristic and are the subject of a statistical study. It encompasses all possible observations or measurements that could be included in the analysis. For example, a population could be all the students in a university, all the trees in a forest, or all the farms in a region. The population provides the complete set of data from which conclusions can be drawn.\nSample\nA sample is a subset of a population selected for the purpose of conducting a statistical analysis. It represents a smaller group drawn from the population, ideally chosen to reflect its characteristics. Samples are used to estimate population parameters when it is impractical or impossible to collect data from the entire population. The key to a good sample is that it should be representative of the population to allow valid inferences to be made.\nPopulation parameter\nA population parameter is a numerical characteristic or value that describes an aspect of an entire population. It is a fixed (constant), often unknown value that represents the true measurement of a specific attribute for every member of the population. Common population parameters include the population mean, population variance, and population proportion. Since it is usually impractical or impossible to measure the entire population, parameters are often estimated using sample data.",

Examples of variables include:\n\nThe number of fruits on a branch, the number of plots in a field, or the number of schools in a country.\nPlant height, crop yield, panicle length, or temperature.\n\nVariables can be classified into two broad categories: quantitative variables, which are measured on a numerical scale (such as height or yield), and qualitative (or categorical) variables, which describe categories or characteristics (such as plant species or color).\nConstants\nA constant refers to a value that does not change under any circumstances. Unlike variables, constants retain the same value throughout the study. Examples of constants include:\n\nMathematical values such as pi (\\(\\pi\\)), which is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter (\\(\\pi\\) = 3.14159…), and e, the base of the natural logarithms (e = 2.71828).",

    "text": "1.8 Types of variables\nQuantitative variables\nA quantitative variable is one that can be expressed in numerical terms and takes values that are measurable. Examples of quantitative variables include the number of fruits on a branch, the number of plots in a field, the number of schools in a country, plant height, crop yield, panicle length, and temperature. Quantitative variables can be further classified into two categories: discrete and continuous.\nDiscrete variables\nDiscrete variables are variables that can only take a finite or countable number of distinct values. They are often whole numbers and can be counted. For instance, the number of fruits on a branch, the number of plots in a field, or the number of schools in a country are all discrete variables.\nSince discrete variables represent countable quantities, they can only take specific, separate values, such as 0, 1, 2, etc. For example, the number of daily hospital admissions is a discrete variable because it can only take whole number values like 0, 1, or 2, but not fractional values like 1.8 or 3.96.\nContinuous variables\nContinuous variables, on the other hand, are variables that can take any value within a given range or interval and can be measured. These variables do not have distinct gaps or interruptions in their possible values. For example, plant height, yield, temperature, and panicle length are continuous variables because they can be measured to a high degree of precision, such as 5.5 cm, 5.8 cm, or any value within a relevant range. Continuous variables can assume an infinite number of possible values within a given range, making them different from discrete variables.\nCategorical variables\nA categorical variable is a type of variable where the data is divided into distinct categories that do not have a numerical value. For example, marital status (single, married, widowed), employment status (employed, unemployed), or religious affiliation (Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, others) are examples of categorical variables. These variables are often referred to as qualitative variables, as they describe qualities or characteristics rather than measurable quantities.\nUnlike quantitative variables, categorical variables cannot be measured or counted in the traditional sense. Instead, they classify data into specific groups or categories.",

    "section": "1.9 Measurement scales",
    "text": "1.9 Measurement scales\nVariables can be classified into four distinct levels of measurement scales each representing a different way of organizing and interpreting data. These four levels are nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.\nNominal scale\nThe nominal scale is the most basic level of measurement and applies to categorical (qualitative) variables. Data measured on the nominal scale consist of categories that are distinct but have no inherent order or ranking. The categories are simply used for labeling or naming objects or groups. For example, gender (male, female), blood group (A, B, AB, O), and marital status (single, married, divorced) are all nominal variables. In the nominal scale, arithmetic operations, such as addition or subtraction, cannot be performed on the data.\nOrdinal scale\nThe ordinal scale also applies to qualitative data, but with an important distinction: the data on the ordinal scale are ordered. This means that the categories have a specific rank or order, but the differences between the categories are not necessarily uniform or meaningful. For example, the grades given in a class (excellent, good, fair, poor) are ordinal, where “excellent” is ranked higher than “good,” and “good” is ranked higher than “fair,” and so on. However, the difference between “excellent” and “good” is not numerically defined, making the exact magnitude of the difference unclear. Ordinal data allows us to say that one value is greater or lesser than another, but it does not allow for the measurement of exact differences.\nInterval scale\nThe interval scale is used for quantitative (numerical) data, and it provides more information than the nominal or ordinal scales. On the interval scale, the data points are ordered, and the differences between them are meaningful and measurable. However, the interval scale does not have a true zero point. This means that while we can measure the difference between values, we cannot make statements about ratios between them. An example of an interval scale is temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit. For instance, if the temperature in two cities is 20°C and 30°C, we can say that the temperature in the second city is 10°C higher. However, we cannot say that the second city is “twice as hot” as the first city, because the zero point (0°C) does not represent the absence of temperature.\nRatio scale\nThe ratio scale is the highest level of measurement and applies to quantitative data. It shares the properties of the interval scale—ordered data with measurable differences between values—but it also has a meaningful zero point. This true zero point represents the total absence of the quantity being measured. With the ratio scale, not only can we measure differences between values, but we can also compute meaningful ratios. For example, weight is measured on the ratio scale. A weight of 60 kg is twice as much as a weight of 30 kg, and a weight of 0 kg indicates the complete absence of weight. Similarly, temperature measured on the Kelvin scale is an example of a ratio scale, where 0 Kelvin represents absolute zero, the complete absence of heat.\nIn summary, the key distinctions between these measurement scales are:\n\nNominal: Categories without any order.\nOrdinal: Ordered categories without consistent differences.\nInterval: Ordered data with meaningful differences, but no true zero.\nRatio: Ordered data with meaningful differences and a true zero point, allowing for meaningful ratios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Classification of variables",

    "text": "1.10 Collection of data\nThe process of collecting data is the foundational step in any statistical investigation or research study. Data can be gathered for an entire population or for a sample drawn from it. Typically, data collection is performed on a sample basis, especially when studying large populations. Collecting data is a challenging task, requiring skill and precision. The person responsible for gathering the data, known as the enumerator or investigator, must be well-trained to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data collected. The individuals or groups providing the information are referred to as the respondents.\n\n1.10.1 Types of data\nData collection can be categorized into two main types based on the source from which the data is derived:\n\nPrimary Data\nSecondary Data\n\nPrimary data\nPrimary data refer to first-hand, original data that are collected directly by the researcher or an organization for a specific purpose. These data have not been processed or analyzed previously and are considered the most authentic form of data. Primary data are typically gathered through surveys, interviews, experiments, or observations, and they represent a direct reflection of the phenomena being studied.\nExample: Population census data collected by the government are considered primary data. These are collected directly from individuals by government authorities for the purpose of census enumeration and demographic analysis.\nSecondary data\nSecondary data refer to data that have already been collected, processed, and published by other organizations or researchers for a different purpose. These data may have undergone some degree of analysis or treatment before being made available for new studies. Secondary data are often more convenient to use, as they are readily accessible, but they may not always perfectly suit the specific needs of the researcher.\nExample: An economic survey of a country, such as reports from the Bureau of Statistics or other governmental agencies, is an example of secondary data. These data were originally collected for purposes such as policy analysis or economic planning, and now can be used for additional research.\nThe distinction between primary and secondary data lies primarily in their origin and the process of collection. Primary data are first-hand, original data collected directly from a single source by the researcher for a specific purpose. These data are considered pure as they have not undergone any prior statistical treatment. In contrast, secondary data are obtained from existing sources or agencies and have been previously collected and processed for different purposes. They are not considered pure as they have undergone some form of statistical treatment. While primary data are original and collected for the first time, secondary data are pre-existing and gathered from other sources. Both types of data have their respective advantages and limitations, and the choice between them depends on the research objectives, availability of resources, and the nature of the study.",

These investigators engage with individuals, asking questions and filling out questionnaires based on the responses. This method is widely used by organizations for larger data collection efforts.\nCollection through questionnaire\nResearchers distribute questionnaires to local representatives or agents who collect data based on their own experience and observations. While this method is relatively quick, it typically provides only a rough estimate of the information.\nThrough the phone\nData is gathered by contacting individuals via telephone/mobile phone.

For instance, it can be seen that 14 of the 20 paddy varieties have plant height between 110 cm and 139 cm (both inclusive). This information cannot easily be obtained from the raw data.\nIt should be noted that, even though above table is concise, some information is lost. For example, the grouped frequency distribution does not give us the exact plant height of the paddy varieties. Thus the individual plant height of the paddy varieties are lost in our effort to obtain an overall picture.\n\n1.14.1 Terminologies\nClass limits\nThe intervals into which the observations are put are called class intervals. The end points of the class intervals are called class limits. For example, the class interval 100 – 109, has lower class limit 100 and upper class limit 109.\nContinuous classes\nContinuous classes are intervals where the class limits represent a continuous range of values, with no gaps between the intervals.\nExample: If the class intervals are 10 − 20, 20−30, 30−40, and so on, there are no gaps between them, and all values within these ranges are included seamlessly.\nDiscontinuous classes\nDiscontinuous classes are intervals where gaps exist between the class limits. In such cases, class boundaries are used to close the gaps and ensure continuity.\nExample:\nIf the class intervals are 10 - 19, 20 - 29, 30 - 39, and so on, there is a gap between the end of one interval and the start of the next. The actual range of each interval is defined using class boundaries, which is explained below.\nClass boundaries\nThe raw data in the above example were recorded to the nearest centimeters. Thus, a plant height of 109.5cm would have been recorded as 110cm, a plant height of 119.4 cm would have been recorded as 119cm, while a plant height of 119.5 cm would have been recorded as 120 cm. It can therefore be seen that, the class interval 110 – 119, consists of measurements greater than or equal to 109.5 cm and less than 119.5 cm. The numbers 109.5 and 119.5 are called the lower and upper boundaries of the class interval 110 – 120. The class boundaries of the other class intervals are given below:\n\n\n\nClass boundary and class limits\n\n\nNote:\nNotice that the lower class boundary of the ith class interval is the mean of the lower class limit of the class interval and the upper class limit of the (i-1)th class interval (i = 2, 3, 4, …). For example, in the table above the lower class boundaries of the second and the fourth class intervals are (110 + 109) /2 = 109.5 and (130 + 129)/2 = 129.5 respectively.\nIt can also be seen that the upper class boundary of the ith class interval is the mean of the upper class limit of the class interval and the lower class limit of the (i+1)th class interval (i = 1, 2, 3, …). Thus, in the above table the upper class boundary of the fourth class interval is (139 + 140)/2 = 139.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor continuous classes, class limits and boundaries are the same because there are no gaps between intervals. However, for discontinuous classes, boundaries are important as they close gaps and ensure every value belongs to one class.\n\n\nClass mark\nThe mid-point of a class interval is called the class mark or class mid-point of the class interval. It is the average of the upper and lower class limits of the class interval. It is also the average of the upper and lower class boundaries of the class interval. For example, in the table, the class mark of the third class interval was found as follows: class mark =(120+129)/2 = (119.5 + 129.5)/2= 124.5.\nClass width\nFor Continuous Classes:\nThe class width is the difference between the upper and lower class limits of a class interval. Since the class limits and boundaries are the same for continuous classes, the width can also be determined by subtracting two consecutive lower or upper class limits.\nFor Discontinuous Classes:\nThe class width is the difference between the upper and lower class boundaries of a class interval. For discontinuous classes, class boundaries are used to account for gaps, and the width can also be determined by subtracting two consecutive lower or upper class boundaries.\nNote: \nIn the grouped frequency table above with discontinuous classes, the width of the second class interval is calculated as |110 - 119| = 9. It can be observed that the width is the same for all classes. This result can also be obtained by taking the numerical difference between the lower class boundaries of the second and third class intervals.\n\n\n1.14.2 Construction\nStep 1. Decide how many classes you wish to use.\nStep 2. Determine the class width\nStep 3. Set up the individual class limits\nStep 4. Tally the items into the classes\nStep 5. Count the number of items in each class\nConsider the example where an agricultural student measured the lengths of leaves on an oak tree (to the nearest cm). Measurements on 38 leaves are as follows\n9, 16, 13, 7, 8, 4, 18, 10, 17, 18,\n9, 12, 5, 9, 9, 16, 1, 8, 17, 1, 10, 5, 9, 11, 15, 6, 14, 9, 1, 12,\n5, 16, 4, 16, 8, 15, 14, 17\nStep 1. Decide how many classes you wish to use.\nH.A. Sturges provides a formula for determining the approximation number of classes. \\[\\mathbf{k = 1 + 3.322}.\\mathbf{\\log}\\mathbf{N}\\] Number of classes should be greater than calculated k\nIn our example N=38, so k= (1+3.322)×log(38) = (1+3.322)×1.5797 = 6.24 = approx 7\nSo the approximated number of classes should be not less than 6.24 i.e.\\(\\ k^{'}\\) =7\nStep 2. Determine the class width\nGenerally, the class width should be the same size for all classes. C= | max − min|/ k. Class width \\(C^{'}\\)should be greater than calculated C. For this example, C = | 18− 1|/6.24 = 2.72, so approximately class width \\(C^{'} =\\) 3 (Note that k used here is the calculated value using Sturges formula not the approximated).\nStep 3. To set up the individual class limits, we need to find the lower limit only\n\\[L = min - \\frac{C^{'} \\times k^{'} - (max - min)}{2}\\]\nwhere C and k here are final approximated class width and number of classes respectively in our example \\(L = 1 - \\frac{(3 \\times 7) - (18 - 1)}{2}\\)=1-2=-1; since there is no negative values in data = 0. Final frequency table will be as shown in Table 1.1\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Frequency distribution table\n\n\n\n\n\nClass\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\n0-3\n3\n\n\n3-6\n5\n\n\n6-9\n5\n\n\n9-12\n9\n\n\n12-15\n5\n\n\n15-18\n9\n\n\n18-21\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though the student only measured in whole numbers, the data is continuous, so “4 cm” means the actual value could have been anywhere from 3.5 cm to 4.5 cm.",

For example, in the above table, it can be seen that 3 leaves have length less than 3.5 cm and 9 leaves (i.e. 3 + 6) have length less than 6.5 cm. These frequencies are called cumulative frequencies. A table of such cumulative frequencies is called a cumulative frequency table or cumulative frequency distribution.\nCumulative frequency is defined as a running total of frequencies. Cumulative frequency can also defined as the sum of all previous frequencies up to the current point. Notice that the last cumulative frequency is equal to the sum of all the frequencies. Two types of cumulative frequencies are Less than Cumulative Frequency (LCF) and Greater than Cumulative Frequency(GCF). LCF is the number of values less than a specified value. GCF is the number of observations greater than a specified value.\nThe specified value for LCF in the case of grouped frequency distribution will be upper limits and for GCF will be the lower limits of the classes. LCF’s are obtained by adding frequencies in the successive classes and GCF are obtained by subtracting the successive class frequencies from the total frequency. see calculated LCF and GCF in Table 1.2 below.",

Reliable and timely information is vital for planners and policymakers to develop effective agricultural policies and make informed decisions on procurement, storage, public distribution, imports, exports, and other related matters. As such, the collection and management of agricultural statistics hold significant importance.\nThis chapter provides an overview of the system for collecting agricultural statistics in India. While agriculture is a State subject, agricultural statistics fall under the concurrent list, resulting in a decentralised system. State Governments, through their State Agricultural Statistics Authorities (SASAs), play a central role in collecting and compiling agricultural statistics at the State level. At the national level, the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, is responsible for compiling the data. Other key agencies involved include the National Statistical Office (NSO) and the State Directorates of Economics and Statistics (DESs).\nCrop statistics comprise two key components: the area sown and the average yield.\nWhile area estimates are derived from land revenue systems, yield estimates are obtained through crop estimation surveys.",

The General Crop Estimation Survey (GCES) covers 65 crops, including 51 food crops and 14 non-food crops. Approximately 9 lakh CCEs are carried out annually in India to estimate the yield of key crops such as rice, maize, bajra, groundnut, and sugarcane. These experiments are conducted systematically to ensure accurate and reliable yield data for principal crops.\n\n\n\nSampling Design under General Crop Estimation Survey\n\n\nFinal estimates of crop production are calculated using area figures obtained through complete enumeration and yield rates derived from crop-cutting experiments. These estimates become available only after the harvest. However, to support timely decision-making, the Government requires advance production estimates.\nThe Directorate of Economics and Statistics (DES), under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, provides advance estimates of crop area and production for key food and non-food crops such as food grains, oilseeds, sugarcane, and fibres. These estimates are issued in four stages:\n\nFirst forecast: Mid-September\n\nSecond forecast: January\n\nThird forecast: Late March\n\nFourth forecast: Late May\n\nIn addition to these forecasts, Final Estimates of crop area and production are published in December. Subsequently, Fully Revised Estimates for all-India crop statistics are released in December of the following crop year.\nAdditionally, information on the structure and characteristics of the agricultural sector is gathered through the Agricultural Census.",

It provides essential information about operational holdings, including their number, area, land use, cropping patterns, and input usage, down to the lowest geographical levels such as villages, tehsils (sub-districts), and districts. This census serves as a statistical framework for planning and conducting future agricultural surveys.\nInitiated in 1970-71, the Agricultural Census is conducted every five years by the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare in collaboration with State and Union Territory administrations. In States with land records, the number and area of operational holdings are collected through complete enumeration, while detailed data on the characteristics of operational holdings are gathered on a sample basis.\nTo date, eleven Agricultural Censuses have been conducted, covering the reference years 1970-71, 1976-77, 1980-81, 1985-86, 1990-91, 1995-96, 2000-01, 2005-06, 2010-11, 2015-16 and 2020-21. The reference period for each census corresponds to the agricultural year, spanning from July to June.\nThe data derived from the Agricultural Census plays a crucial role in policy formulation, resource allocation, and the overall development of the agricultural sector in India.\nAdditional data pertaining to various sectors can be obtained from the sources listed in the Appendix 1\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuotes to Inspire\n\n\n\n“Statistics is the art of never having to say you’re certain.” – W.

While frequency distributions in tabular form help organize raw data, graphical representations provide a more intuitive way to understand patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. By converting numbers into visual elements, graphs make it simpler to convey information effectively, making them indispensable tools in research, analysis, and communication. Depending on the nature of the data and the intended purpose, various types of graphs and diagrams can be employed to illustrate key insights. This chapter focuses on the fundamental graphs and charts used in statistics to visually represent data.\nA histogram is a graphical representation used to display the frequency distribution of continuous data. It consists of adjacent rectangles, where:\nUnlike bar charts, histograms have no gaps between the rectangles, emphasizing the continuity of the data.

This is illustrated in the following example.\nFigure 3.8 shows the distribution of sales of agricultural produce from a Farm in 1995, 1996 and 1997 and its corresponding component barchart in Figure 3.9.\nThe component bar chart shows the changes of each component over the years as well as the comparison of the total sales between different years.\nGrouped bar chart\nFigure 3.8 can also be represented using a grouped bar chart shown in Figure 3.10.

In this chapter, we shift our focus to statistical measures that describe the characteristics of a dataset.\nOne key aspect of data analysis is identifying a single value that represents the overall dataset. This is where measures of central tendency come into play. These are summary statistics that capture the center or typical value of a dataset, providing a concise numerical summary.\nThere are five commonly used averages: mean, median, and mode, collectively referred to as simple averages, and geometric mean and harmonic mean, known as special averages. These measures provide insights into the central value of the data, making them fundamental tools for understanding and interpreting data distributions. We will discuss these measures in two sections, here we will discuss on simple averages.\nRequisites of a Good Measure of Central Tendency:\nThe main objectives of Measure of Central Tendency:\nThis is what people usually intend when they say “average”. Arithmetic mean or simply the mean of a variable is defined as the sum of the observations divided by the number of observations. Mean of set of numbers \\(x_{1\\ },x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}\\) is denoted as \\(\\overline{x}\\). It is given by the formula\n\\[\\overline{x} = \\frac{x_{1} + x_{2} + \\ldots + x_{n}}{n}\\]\n\\[= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_{i}\\]\nExample 4.1 Find the mean of the numbers 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12\n\\[\\overline{x} = \\frac{2 + 4 + 7 + 8 + 11 + 12}{6} = \\frac{44}{6} = 7.33\\]",

    "text": "4.5 Median of grouped frequency distribution\nThe exact value of the median of a grouped data cannot be obtained because the actual values of a grouped data are not known. For a grouped frequency distribution, the median is in the class interval which contains the \\(\\left( \\frac{N}{2} \\right)^{\\text{th}}\\)ordered observation, where \\(N\\) is the total number of observations. This class interval is called the median class. The median of a grouped frequency distribution can be estimated by either of the following two methods:\nLinear interpolation method\nThe median of a grouped frequency distribution can be estimated by linear interpolation. We assume that the observations are evenly spread through the median class. The median can then be computed by using the following formula:\n\\[Median = L + \\left( \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}N - F}{f_{m}} \\right)C\\]\nwhere \\(N\\) = total number of observations, \\(L\\) = lower limit of the median class, \\(F\\) = sum of all frequencies below L(cumulative frequency), \\(f_{m}\\) = frequency of the median class, \\(C\\) = class width of the median class.\nEstimation from cumulative frequency curve\nThe median of a grouped frequency distribution can be estimated from a cumulative frequency curve. A horizontal line is drawn from the point \\(\\frac{\\text{N}}{2}\\) on the vertical axis to meet the cumulative frequency curve. From the point of intersection, a vertical line is dropped to the horizontal axis. The value on the horizontal axis is equal to the median.\n\n\n\nmedian from a cumulative frequency curve\n\n\nExample 4.7 Table below gives the distribution of the heights of 60 students in a Senior High school.

    "text": "5.1 Geometric mean\nWhile simple averages like mean, median, and mode are widely used to summarize data, certain situations call for more specialized measures to capture the essence of a dataset. Special averages, including the geometric mean and harmonic mean, are tailored for specific contexts where the nature of the data or the relationships between data points require a different approach.\nThe geometric mean is a specialized measure of central tendency, particularly suited for datasets involving growth rates, ratios, or percentages, such as population growth, investment returns, or interest rates. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which calculates the average by summing values, the geometric mean finds the average by multiplying values and then taking the root (typically the nth root for n values).\nThis approach captures the compounding effects present in the data, making the geometric mean an essential tool for accurately summarizing proportional changes or rates over time. Its utility lies in providing a more representative measure for datasets where changes are multiplicative rather than additive.\nThe geometric mean of a series containing n observations is the nth root of the product of the values.

    "text": "5.4 AM, GM or HM ?\nChoosing the right average depends on what you’re measuring and how the data behaves. Let’s break it down step by step in a simple way:\nArithmetic Mean (AM)\nThe arithmetic mean is the most common type of average. You use it when the values in your data add together in a straightforward way. This is suitable for quantities like:\n- Heights or weights\n- Lengths or distances\n- Marks in exams\nFor example, if you want to find the average height of students in a class, you add up all the heights and divide by the number of students. The arithmetic mean gives a meaningful average because height or weight adds linearly—it’s a direct measurement.\nHarmonic Mean (HM)\nThe harmonic mean is useful when you are working with rates, ratios, or situations where quantities add up as reciprocals. Some examples include:\n- Speeds (distance per unit time)\n- Capacitors in a series circuit\n- Rates like fuel efficiency or cost per unit\nFor instance, imagine you are driving the same distance at different speeds. If you want to find the average speed for the entire trip, the harmonic mean is the best choice. This is because speeds relate inversely to time—when you go faster, you take less time, and vice versa.\nGeometric Mean (GM)\nThe geometric mean is the right choice when your data involves multiplication or compounding, such as:\n- Growth rates (like population growth or interest rates)\n- Percentages (like inflation rates)\n- Ratios\nFor example, if you have annual interest rates for 10 years and want to find a single rate that represents the same total growth over that period, the geometric mean gives you the answer. It works by multiplying the rates and taking the root, which accounts for the compounding effect.\nKey Takeaways\n1. Use Arithmetic Mean when values combine directly, like adding lengths or weights.\n2. Use Harmonic Mean for rates or quantities that work reciprocally, like speed or resistance.\n3. Use Geometric Mean for data involving multiplication or compounding, like growth rates or percentages.\nBy understanding the relationship between the data and the type of average, you can choose the most meaningful measure for your analysis.",

See in the example the procedure followed when a fraction appear in the calculation.\nExample 5.6: Compute quartiles for the data 25, 18, 30, 8, 15, 5, 10, 35, 40, 45\nSolution 5.6:\nFirst arrange the data in ascending order\n5, 8, 10, 15, 18, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45\nhere n = 10\n\\(\\mathbf{Q}_{\\mathbf{1}}\\mathbf{=}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{n + 1}}{\\mathbf{4}} \\right)^{\\mathbf{\\text{th}}}\\)item\ni.e. \\(Q_{1} = \\left( \\frac{10 + 1}{4} \\right)^{th}\\) = 2.75th item; when such a fraction appears we use the following procedure\n\\(Q_{1} =\\)2.75th item = 2nd item + 0.75(3rd item – 2nd item)\nSo from the given data \\(Q_{1}\\)= 8+0.75(10– 8) = 9.5\n\\[\\mathbf{Q}_{\\mathbf{2}}\\mathbf{= median}\\]\nhere \\(Q_{2} =\\)(18+25)/2 = 21.5\n\\(\\mathbf{Q}_{\\mathbf{3}}\\mathbf{=}\\left( \\frac{\\mathbf{3(n + 1)}}{\\mathbf{4}} \\right)^{\\mathbf{\\text{th}}}\\)item\ni.e. \\(Q_{3} = \\left( 3 \\times \\frac{(10 + 1)}{4} \\right)^{th}\\) = 8.25th item = 8th item + 0.25(9th item –8th item) = 35+0.25(40-35) =36.25\n\n5.6.1 Quartiles of a discrete frequency data\n\nFind cumulative frequencies.\nFind \\(\\left( \\frac{\\mathbf{n + 1}}{\\mathbf{4}} \\right)\\)\nSee in the cumulative frequencies, the value just greater than \\(\\left( \\frac{\\mathbf{n + 1}}{\\mathbf{4}} \\right)\\) , then the corresponding value of \\(x\\) is \\(Q_{1}\\)\nFind \\(\\left( \\frac{\\mathbf{3(n + 1)}}{\\mathbf{4}} \\right)\\)\nSee in the cumulative frequencies, the value just greater than \\(\\left( \\frac{\\mathbf{3(n + 1)}}{\\mathbf{4}} \\right)\\) ,then the corresponding value of \\(x\\) is \\(Q_{3}\\)\n\nExample 5.7: Compute quartiles for the data given bellow\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{x}\\)\n5\n8\n12\n15\n19\n24\n30\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{f}\\)\n4\n3\n2\n4\n5\n2\n4\n\n\n\nSolution 5.7:\n\n\n\nx\nf\ncf\n\n\n\n\n5\n4\n4\n\n\n8\n3\n7\n\n\n12\n2\n9\n\n\n15\n4\n13\n\n\n19\n5\n18\n\n\n24\n2\n20\n\n\n30\n4\n24\n\n\n\nHere n =24\n\\(\\left( \\frac{\\mathbf{n + 1}}{\\mathbf{4}} \\right)\\) = \\(\\left( \\frac{\\mathbf{n + 1}}{\\mathbf{4}} \\right)\\mathbf{\\ }\\)= \\(\\left( \\frac{\\mathbf{25}}{\\mathbf{4}} \\right)\\)= 6.25\nThe cumulative frequency value just greater than 6.25 is 7, the\n\\(\\mathbf{x}\\) value corresponding to cumulative frequency 7 is 8.

    "text": "Welcome\nWelcome to the Textbook of Agricultural Statistics – a comprehensive resource thoughtfully crafted by the Department of Agricultural Statistics at the College of Agriculture, Vellayani, Kerala Agricultural University. This book was created to meet the need for a clear, accessible, and practical guide to statistics tailored for agricultural research.\nStatistics is an essential tool in agriculture, enabling researchers and practitioners to uncover patterns, validate results, and make data-driven decisions. However, the subject is often perceived as complex and challenging to master. This textbook is designed to change that perception, offering straightforward explanations and practical guidance to make statistical concepts approachable and applicable.\nAs John Tukey once said, “The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.” We have embraced this philosophy by incorporating clear examples, practical applications, and data visualizations to illustrate concepts and deepen understanding.\nWhile this book is primarily written with undergraduate students in mind, its simplicity and focus on real-world applications make it a valuable resource for a wide audience, including postgraduate students, researchers, and anyone seeking to build a strong foundation in statistics and experimental design.\nYou will find clear explanations, practical examples, and step-by-step instructions throughout the chapters, all tailored to the unique needs of agricultural studies. Our goal is to ensure that learners at all levels can confidently apply statistical methods to their work and research.\nWhether you are new to statistics or looking to revisit the basics with a fresh perspective, we hope this book serves as a supportive companion in your journey to understanding and applying statistical tools effectively in agriculture.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis book is the result of collaborative efforts among dedicated teachers and statisticians, but the majority of the reviewing, editing, and refinement has been inspired and shaped by the students.\nFor two years, this book was made available online on the MeLON (Module for eLearning and Online Notes) platform of the College of Agriculture, Vellayani. During this time, students provided valuable feedback, pointed out areas for improvement, and offered insights that greatly enhanced the quality and clarity of the content. We are sincerely grateful to all the students whose suggestions and input played a key role in the development of this textbook.\nWe would also like to thank the College of Agriculture, Vellayani, for fostering an environment that encourages learning, growth, and the sharing of ideas.\n\n\nNote from the Publisher\nThis textbook is published by PAPAYA, the publication division of Statoberry LLP, which is committed to providing high-quality educational resources for agricultural research. The online version of this book is available for free, in line with our dedication to open access and knowledge sharing. Visit us at PAPAYA.\n\n\nCopyright Information\n© 2024 Statoberry LLP.
